Ever found yourself on the app store trying to find a DJ app only to realize the existing ones are terrible so you

Traditional music mixing applications lacking serious features real DJ controllers have, so we decided to 
create our own. 

Hey I'm Ari! As a DJ I noticed the lack of features iOS DJ Applications contained compared to actual DJ mixers like my own. 
Hopping headfirst into Swift and iOS development, Komal(@kshriv) and I gave xCode a shot and loved the process. (Built for iPhone 8 because I'm broke and don't have an X ðŸ˜…)

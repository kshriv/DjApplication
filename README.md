Ever found yourself on the app store trying to find a DJ app only to realize the existing ones are terrible so you 
should just build your own? Me too! 

## My first app!
I was tired of the traditional music mixing applications lacking serious features real DJ controllers have, so I decided to 
create my own. As a DJ I noticed the lack of features iOS DJ Applications contained compared to actual DJ mixers like my own. 
Hopping headfirst into Swift and iOS development, I gave xCode a shot and loved the process. (Built for iPhone 8 because I'm broke and don't have an X ðŸ˜…)

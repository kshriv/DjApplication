Ever found yourself on the app store trying to find a DJ app only to realize the existing ones are terrible so you 
should just build your own? Me too! 

## My first app!
I was tired of the traditional music mixing applications lacking serious features real DJ controllers have, so I decided to 
create my own. As a DJ I noticed the lack of features iOS DJ Applications contained compared to actual DJ mixers like my own. 
Hopping headfirst into Swift and iOS development, I gave xCode a shot and loved the process. 

## Features:
• Choose from a list of songs to mix with

• Set a loop using the loop page to get a cleaner mix

• Set up to four cue points within the songs to jump around the track easier

• Access a sampler with four different sounds to overlay your mix with

• Use the crossfader to jump from deck to deck to get that perfect mix
